# Deep-Learning-Based-Renal-Fibrosis-Detection-Insights-from-Glomerular-Biopsies


Renal fibrosis is a debilitating condition characterized by the excessive accumulation of scar tissue in the kidneys, leading to structural damage and impaired function. Early detection of renal fibrosis through histopathological analysis of kidney biopsy images plays a crucial role in effective diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a deep learning model for the automatic detection of renal fibrosis in glomerular biopsy images. Leveraging a dataset containing annotated images of kidney glomeruli obtained from the University of St. La Salle and hosted by Roboflow, our model aims to uncover histopathological features and patterns indicative of fibrotic kidney disease. The dataset comprises 4397 images annotated with labels indicating whether they are classified as normal or sclerosed. Through deep learning techniques, our model enhances diagnostic accuracy by detecting and classifying histological features associated with renal diseases in digital pathology images, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare management.




INTRODUCTION

1.	ABOUT

Renal fibrosis is characterized by excessive scar tissue accumulation in the kidneys, causing structural damage and impaired function. Associated with hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc.Diagnosis: Clinical evaluation, lab tests, imaging, kidney biopsy.The approximate prevalence of CKD(chronic kidney disease) is 800 per million population.In India , diabetes and hypertension today account for 40–60% cases of CKD
 

2.	OBJECTIVE
Develop a deep learning model to automatically detect renal fibrosis in glomerular biopsy images, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early intervention for patients with kidney diseases.
